# Domain Driven Core

Domain Driven Core is the base for the CodefyPHP framework which includes interfaces and abstractions for domain driven 
development as well as CQRS. You can use the default implementations or use the interfaces to build your own DDD/CQRS
implementations.

## Requirement

PHP 8.2+

## Installation

```composer require codefyphp/domain-driven-core```

## Acknowledgements

The domain driven core library benefits greatly from the original authors of [Chief](https://github.com/adamnicholson/Chief)
and [Buttercup.Protects](https://github.com/buttercup-php/protects).
